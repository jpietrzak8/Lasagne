<h1>Lasagne Documentation</h1>

<p>
Lasagne is a fairly simple app which ties together a barcode scanner with
a small spreadsheet.  The expected use is to take the phone to where items
are located, collect their associated barcodes, and then download those
barcodes into a standard spreadsheet program on another computer.
<p>

<h2>Main Screen</h2>

<p>
The majority of the main Lasagne screen is a view onto the spreadsheet.
Below this is a row of controls, consisting of an icon that looks like
a plus sign (used to add new rows), a space for a cell label, an editor
(to modify the content of cells), and an icon that looks like a minus sign
(used to access a variety of miscellaneous actions).
</p>

<p>
When you first start Lasagne, the spreadsheet will be empty.  It will need
to be populated by scanning items in via the Add New Row button (which is
described below).  However, when Lasagne is closed, it will remember the
spreadsheet file currently in use, and reload that file the next time it
is launched.
</p>

<h3>Spreadsheet</h3>

<p>
The spreadsheet functionality is limited.  It contains five
columns (Barcode, Name, Description, Quantity, and Location) which, at
the moment, cannot be modified.  Individual cells can be selected and
edited; all cells are treated as string data, so no mathematical functions
can be applied.
</p>

<h3>Add New Row Button</h3>

<p>
New rows are added to the spreadsheet via the Add New Row button (which
looks like a plus sign).  Clicking on this button will bring up the barcode
scanner window.  Please see "Barcode Scanning" below for more information.
</p>

<h3>Cell Editor</h3>

<p>
At the center bottom of the main screen is the cell editor.  When you click
on an individual cell, the contents of that cell are displayed in the editor.
If you modify the contents of that editor and then press return (the key that
looks like a bent arrow), the cell will be updated to contain those new
contents.
</p>

<h3>Actions Button</h3>

<p>
The Actions button (which looks like a minus sign) contains a selection of
commonly-used actions.  The first two actions are "Clear Cell" and "Remove
Row"; both of these actions require that you first select a cell.  The
"Clear Cell" action will remove the contents of the chosen cell; the 
"Remove Row" action will remove the entire row containing the selected cell.
Please note that these actions cannot be un-done!
</p>

<p>
The file manipulation actions are "Load Spreadsheet", "Save Spreadsheet", and
"Save Spreadsheet As".  By default, all spreadsheets are stored in the
user's "Documents" directory (which is "/home/user/MyDocs/.documents"),
but Lasagne should be able to store and retrieve files from any directory
you would like to use.  The "Save Spreadsheet" command will simply save
the current spreadsheet data to the current file; the "Load" and
"Save As" actions will first ask you to select the name of a file before
loading or saving, respectively.
</p>

<p>
Lasagne saves its data in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">Comma Separated Values (CSV)</a>
format.  This should make it fairly easy to import Lasagne files into more
full-featured spreadsheet applications.
</p>

<h2>Barcode Scanning</h2>

<p>
Lasagne uses a separate window for scanning barcodes, which is activated by
pressing the "Add New Row" button on the main screen.  This window consists
of a video display from the phone's main camera (on the left side), and
an array of buttons on the right side.
</p>

<p>
The intended use here is that you place the camera at an appropriate distance
from an item's barcode, allow Lasagne to scan the barcode, fill in the
rest of the details for the item (on a dialog box that appears), and then
move on to the next item.  When you have finished collecting barcodes,
simply hit the "close" button (or the blue "return" arrow at the top right
of the screen).
</p>

<p>
There are a handful of controls on the right of the screen to control the
video input:
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>

<p>
This button will toggle the camera's LED.  This is useful for scanning
barcodes in dark conditions.
</p>

<h3>Focus Up / Focus Down</h3>

<p>
These buttons will change the focus distance of the camera.  However,
please note that modifying the focus manually can take a great deal of
time; simply moving the camera itself to an appropriate distance from
the barcode is much faster.  (This is also much faster than using the
autofocus mechanism; and since there are several other downsides with
using autofocus, it is not currently supported in Lasagne.)
</p>

<h3>Exp Up / Exp Down</h3>

<p>
These controls manage the camera's "Exposure" value.  This control can be
particularly handy in situations where the ambient light is especially
bright or dim, or when the barcode is placed on a reflective surface.
</p>

<h3>New Item Entry Dialog</h3>

<p>
Each time a barcode is detected, a dialog box will pop up; this dialog
allows you to enter additonal information about the item.  You are free
to edit some, all, or none of these fields.  When you press "Done", the
item will be added to the spreadsheet.  You can also click off the top of
the dialog box to cancel adding this item to the spreadsheet.
